  <h2>Context Required</h2>
  <small>A brief history of our relationship to serverless.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <pre>Nov 2014: chilly PnW morning AWS Lambda was released</pre>
  <pre class=fragment>me: this is interesting *</pre>
  <pre class=fragment>





* said warming my hands over a dumpster fire of HTTP servers
</pre>
</section>
<section>
  <pre class=fragment>Aug 2015: api gateway release </pre>
  <pre class=fragment>me: ... it is time then</pre>
</section>
<section>
  <pre>We started work on what would become Architect that November and</pre>
  <pre>Lambda was roughly one year old ‚Ä¶API Gateway barely a few months old<pre>
</section>
<section>
  We were VERY aware this was early and going to be painful. <b>It was.</b>
</section>
<section>But‚Ä¶why go <b>servers-less</b> then?</section>
<section>
  <h3>Only paying for what you use üí∏</h3> (üíØ% utilization)
</section>
<section>
<h3>Better security model üîê</h3>
No ports to scan!
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Focusing on business value üí∞</h3> instead of managing infra
</section>

<section>
<h3>3 üîë reasons to serverless</h3>
<ul style=text-align:left>
<li class=fragment>üí∞ Fixed costs
<li class=fragment>üîí Better security
<li class=fragment>üé¢ Faster iterations
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Mini-talk: 3 things that totally sucked about serverless late 2015</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Coldstart!
    <li>DynamoDB or gtfo
    <li>Cloudformation support
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Coldstart</h3>
<pre class=fragment>We observed the problem</pre>
<pre class=fragment>We observed cold start correlated to the function payload size</pre>
  <pre class=fragment>We determined that sub 5mb functions remained consistently subsecond</pre>
  <pre class=fragment>We started authoring sub 5mb functions</pre>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>3 things that</h3>
  <h1>DO NOT</h1>
  <h3>solve coldstart</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>pings</h3>
  <h1 class=fragment>DOES NOT</h1>
  <h3 class=fragment>solve coldstart</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>lambda warmers</h3>
  <h1 class=fragment>DOES NOT</h1>
  <h3 class=fragment>solve coldstart</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>putting web servers into functions</h3>
  <h1 class=fragment>DOES NOT</h1>
  <h3 class=fragment>solve coldstart</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Sub 5mb Lambda functions</h3>
  <h1 class=fragment>MOSTLY</h1>
  <h3 class=fragment>solves coldstart</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <small>Consider using a framework, like <a href=https://arc.codes>arc.codes</a>, that encourages small functions.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>DynamoDB or GTFO</h3>
</section>
<section>
  We tried using traditional databases, elastic search and elastic cache (redis)
</section>
<section>
  <h3>It was swimming upstream</h3>
  <small class=fragment>But it is better now</small>
</section>
<section>
  DynamoDB consistently great product that just keeps getting better
</section>
<section>
  Maybe you can avoid DynamoDB by using‚Ä¶ S3?!
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Cloudformation</h3>
  <div style=text-align:left>
  <small class=fragment>1. Did not support the services we needed it to</small><br>
  <small class=fragment>2. Severe limits (200 ish resources)</small><br>
  <small class=fragment>3. Really slow iteration cycles (for us and them!)</small><br>
  <small class=fragment>4. Verbose and difficult to debug configuration</small><br>
  </div>
</section>
<section>
  <small>Begrudgingly, and like so many before us,  we started by writing our own provisioning scripts.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <small>Our goal was to support building a database backed web app.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <small>We needed the primitives for CRUD apps: http routes, fast read/write of structured data and background tasks.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <small>We wanted iteration speed, zero downtime deploys, stateful http via stateless endpoints.</small>
</section>
<section>
  Build one to throw away?

  <h3>Mini talk: 17 Lessons Learned</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 1: Coldstart can be defeated</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 2: Small functions better on all dimensions</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 3: NO functions is even better</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 4: convention > configuration</h3>
  <small>Config is liability just as much as code. Seek to eliminate it with conventions and smarter defaults.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 5: Namespace units of deployment</h3>
  <small>Infra is cattle; versions belong to revision control not deployment artifacts</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 6: Deps need to be in sync within a deployment namespace</h3>
  <small>deps needed to be automated and synchronized across a namespace of deployment</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 7: There is Common Code</h3>
  <small>There will be common code that needs to be shared within a deployment namespace</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 8: Runtime needs Context</h3>
  <small>runtime needs to know about its app context (find resources: tables, buckets, broadcast events or to publish to queues</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 9: functions are cheap/disposable</h3>
  <small>run lots; ideally in parallel</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 10: functions can be deployed in parallel</h3>
  <small>Monolithic apps have lots of functions too‚Ä¶ and no isolation. They cannot be deployed in parallel ever.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 11: DynamoDB is Fucking Awesome</h3>
  <small>Just use it ok.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 12: S3 and Lambda are amazing together</h3>
  <small>use it for static assets. use it for JSON data.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 13a: evented everything</h3>
  <small>take everything possible off the user path with either sns events or sqs queues</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 13b: SQS and SNS are subtly different</h3>
  <small>Slightly different approaches and guarentees for delivery.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 13c: Cloudwatch Scheduled Events</h3>
  <small>Super powerful combined with feedback control systems.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 13d: State Machines?</h3>
  <small>queues/events/scheduled can be consolidated into a single primitive 'step function'</small>
</section>
<section>
  Bonus!
  <h3>Lesson 14: Lambda works REAL GOOD with S3</h3>
  <small>Static assets</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 14b: Lambda works REAL GOOD with S3</h3>
  <small>Flat file data base?
    <li>S3 Select
    <li>S3 Batch
  </small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 15: Regions are a leaky abstraction</h3>
  <small>
    <li>regionless will be a thing: stacksets?
    <li>CDN is only part of the story
  </small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 16: Accounts are the best unit of isolation</h3>
  <small>
    <li>one per person
    <li>bonus: one per person per app!
  </small>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Lesson 17: Infra as Code</h3>
  <small>
    <li>Non optional! as in: required
    <li>Reproducability and determinism
    <li>Precursors: chef, puppet, anisible, salt, reems of fucking yaml/bash
    <li>Rising stars: Terraform (2014), CFN (2011), SAM (Nov 2016)
  </small>

  <h2>
  What did we do with what we learned...?
  </h2>
</section>
<section>
  We did the unthinkable.
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Heresy #1</h3>
  We created a manifest format <code>.arc</code> which stood for 'amazon run commands' because we wanted to be cool like .bashrc, .vimrc, etc
</section>
<section>
  goals
</section>
<section>
  Be terse and as syntax free as possible; solve for one of the biggest problems of XML
</section>
<section>
  Have comments; solve for one of the biggest problems of JSON
</section>
<section>
  Discourage nesting; solving for the biggest problem of YAML
</section>
<section>
  Support for basic scalar values: <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code>, <code>Boolean</code>
</section>
<section>
  Support for complex values: <code>Vector</code> and <code>Map</code>
</section>
<section>
REALLY terse; we want to express the infrastructure with the minimum readable syntax
</section>
<section>
REALLY terse; we want to remember how to express infra without reference docs
</section>

  Heresy #2
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Architect was not Cloudformation based</h2>
  <small>Was not a realistic option for our requirements at that time.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Aside: Don't Judge Tech Choices</h2>
  <h3 class=fragment>Unless it is K8s</h3>
  <small class=fragment>Haha, jk. Rails is cool.</small>
</section>
<section>
  <small>Stable! Documented! Tested!</small>
  <h1>Architect 5.x üéâ</h1>
  <small>NOT Cloudformation based üò≠; install <a href=https://arc.codes>arc.codes</a>.</small>
</section> 
<section>
  <small>SAM/CFN based <b style=color:hotpink>ALPHA</b>! <strike>Documented! Tested!</strike></small>
  <h1>Architect 6.x üéâ</h1>
  <code>npm install -g @architect/cli</code>
</section>
<section>
  WARNING! Beta code. Demo gremlins. Etc!
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Architect 6.x Highlights</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Work locally!
    <li>Staging and production are first class concepts
    <li>Node, Python and Ruby fully supported
    <li>Export as <code>sam.json</code>
    <li>Deploy with Cloudformation
    <li>üÜï Dirty deploy 
    <li>Distribute with SAR
  </ol>
</section>
<!-- 
- while that deploy is running lets look at the delta between configuration formats
- quantifiably 10x developer using Architect
- closing thoughts
  - building infra as code is absolutely the future
      - self care (no servers to patch)
      - wallet care (100% utilization is also good for the environment)
      - faster iterations!
      - incredibly enabling technology; focus on the business logic 
      - but also cheap experiments and faster learning
  - CDK is absolutely interesting af
  - interop with the CFN ecosystem is badass: Macros, Nested Stacks, SAR
  - s3 should not need dirty deploy tricks
  - still need a CI system: try out begin.com if you want gitops on easy mode
